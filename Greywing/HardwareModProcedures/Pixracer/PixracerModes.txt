--Airspeed sensor: Solder 4 pigtails to the back of the GPS connector - power, ground, I2C SCL, I2C SDA
This will allow airspeed sensor and mags to be on same I2C buss
(note only use MS4525DO sensor, the new MS5525 sensor is very sensitive to moisture)

--If using telemetery out to FrSky RC transciever: Solder together FRS (FrSky) 2 center pins. (FrSky OUT & IN on the accompanying schematic)
