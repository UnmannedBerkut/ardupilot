...In simulation (SITL)

You will need a GCS. Many are available (Mission Planner, QGC, AP Planner)
All of them suck except for Mission Planner, but it is Windoze only
To install QGC: https://docs.qgroundcontrol.com/en/getting_started/download_and_install.html
$ sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
$ sudo apt-get remove modemmanager -y
$ sudo apt install gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad gstreamer1.0-libav -y (only necessary for video)

$ chmod +x ./QGroundControl.AppImage
$ ./QGroundControl.AppImage

Build and run simulator. From ardupilot dir
$ ./waf clean
$ ./waf distclean
$ cd ArduPlane
$ ../Tools/autotest/sim_vehicle.py -D --custom-location=32.70119,-117.25411,40,0 --add-param-file=../Greywing/SimSettings.param

Connect sim to GCS:
Add a TCP comm link - 127.0.0.1 port 5762 or 5763

Build a misison:
-First misison waypoint should be takeoff - set pitch to 15deg and alt to something reasonable (100m)
-Add waypoints as desired
-Last waypoint should be a "jump to item" (aka DO_JUMP). Set item number to second waypoint (not the takeoff waypoint (or whatever you want) and repeat to -1 (indefinate)
-If Jump waypoint is not set, RTL flight mode will be set after last wpt (return to home)

To takeoff:
Set Desired airspeed (20m/s is reasonable) (TRIM_ARSPD_CM = 20 via GCS or param set)
Arm vehicle
change flight mode to AUTO (should have been in MANUAL)

Flight modes tested:
MAN (joystick req)
FBWA (joystick req)
FBWB  (joystick req)
LOIT
AUTO
GUIDED

Useful SITL commands: http://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/using-sitl-for-ardupilot-testing.html

From the running simulator command line
param set SIM_WIND_DIR 180
param set SIM_WIND_SPD 10
param set SIM_WIND_TURB 1
param set SIM_RC_FAIL 1
param set SIM_GPS_DISABLE 1
(or params can be set via the GCS)

SR1_... sets the transmitted rate of various telem messages from aircraft->GCS
